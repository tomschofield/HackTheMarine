'The Sea Word' takes marine data and marine folk music and does interesting things with it

Infinite ShipShanty is terminal-based Python artware by tomschofield and theseanco in which sea shanties scraped using 
Tom Schofield's shanty scraper and a live-scraped met-office shipping forecast are generatively mashed together.
The script will need sea shanties to be scraped to a folder and the folder pointed to in the script in order to work - see the comments at the top of the script
